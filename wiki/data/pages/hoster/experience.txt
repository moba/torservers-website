  * 07/03/2011 ordered 
  * slow - bad peering? 3 Peerings: http://www.fixedorbit.com/AS/39/AS39743.htm http://www.fixedorbit.com/cgi-bin/cgirange.exe?ASN=39743
  * See: http://bgp.he.net/AS39743#_graph4 <-- Only one real peer. Tiny bit to HE.net
  * http://www.freelists.org/post/torservers/maumau-low-throughput,4 (and following)

While bandwidth improved a bit over time, we decided to cancel the server nevertheless. T-N offered to register a subnet for us for 150 setup and 150 per year, and 15/mnth for routing, but at that time speeds weren't improving so much and the data center didn't seem to be too interested in hosting Tor exits. T-N might still be a good choice for someone else to run an exit, and they told us they were upgrading capacity soon, so it is worth another look.

=====100tb.com (US) =====

We were running a high bandwidth exit node in their US Datacenter from June 2010 till January 2011 for 200$/month [[http://www.torservers.net/status/softlayer.png]] but after repeated DMCA complaints they terminated our contract because of their network provider Softlayer.

Over the first few months, they told us SWIP is not possible. After
telling them for each and every single complaint that SWIP would help,
we got them to do it. They refused to add our abuse contact handle, so
it didn't help much, but still.

100tb.com did understand what service we provide (Tor exit node) and offered to provide a new server in their UK datacenter.
===== EvoBoxes.net (NL) =====
http://www.evoboxes.net/

After contacting them regarding a custom build offer for an exit node they provided us with an unmetered 100Mbit/s VPS for free. After a week they upgraded the node to 200Mbit/s unmetered! This node was donated to us on 11/02/2011 and is maintained and managed by us (torservers.net).

  * 17/03/2011 - Evoboxes was asked to shut down the exit node after police contacted their host. (and they did)
  * Recommended NForce.nl which worked out really well! 

=====FDCservers (CZ)=====
http://www.fdcservers.net/
 
  * [[http://www.freelists.org/post/torservers/FDCServers-Fwd-Re-1Gbit-Hosting-in-EU,17|28/02/2011]] We ordered a 1Gbit/s unmetered server for 300$/months in their Czech datacenter. 
  * [[http://www.freelists.org/post/torservers/FDC-1-GBIT-exit-online|02/03/2011]] Node is up and running (6 Tor instances)
  * We haven't had any problems with the ISP so far (as of 05/03/2011).
